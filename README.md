1. Once you've cloned this, create a branch locally - name it something descriptive 
2. From your local branch, create a new directory titled with your name
3. Inside of that directory, create a new file called "README.md"
4. Open that file in atom
5. Add 3 sentences about a course of your choosing
6. `git add .`
7. `git commit -m "this is my message"`
8. `git push origin BRANCH-NAME`
9. Submit a pull request
